# betterLayerTab
Based on super alt-tab to achieve perfect layer-tab

Instead of using a fixed timer to release alt, which is hard to use and not nearly a perfect solution, 
use IS_LAYER_OFF(layer) as the condition works perfectly, just like a normal alt tab! 

All you need to do is bind ALT_TAB on your tab key on the layer! 
And change the "layer" to your layer name in line 21.
